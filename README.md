# MinecraftBackup
This will probably destroy your Minecraft worlds, erase all your data, create a new world order and run away with your SO and leave you behind broken hearted.
Maybe it will create a Zip file in your Documents\MCBackup folder containing all your Minecraft Windows 10 Edition worlds.
This is my first try with C# and is probably very bad coding.



Enjoy
